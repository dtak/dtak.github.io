      blurb: |-
        My research focuses on reasoning in uncertainty, causal inference, and learning interpretable models for medical decision-making and problems in healthcare. I completed my PhD in 2019 at the University of Basel in Switzerland, where I was advised by Prof. Volker Roth.  Prior to this, I received my MSc at the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa. Apart from research, I enjoy travelling, learning about other cultures, playing badminton and cooking.

      blurb: |-
        I am interested in uncertainty estimation for deep models; more broadly, I am interested in building models with gauranteed properties that align with task-specific desiderata, such as interpretability, risk-awareness, satifaction of domain-specific constraints. I like to spend my spare time engineering DtAK shennanigans.

      blurb: |-
        I work on probabilistic models, interpretable machine learning, and healthcare applications. I am interested in personalizing mental healthcare and advances in Bayesian neural networks. I want my research to have an impact in the world, for which I collaborate regularly with psychiatrists at Massachusetts General Hospital, and experts in Human-Computer-Interaction. How can we better quantify uncertaint? How can we design expressive, interpretable priors in Bayesian models? How can we combine human knowledge with data-driven evidence? I love Japanese culture, sports of any kind, and playing with my dwarf rabbit Taiko.

        I did my undergrad at UC Berkeley in Applied Math and a minor in American History. In industry, I worked for 2 years as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon. I was the technical lead for mobile app development in the acquisition of Whole Foods Market onto Amazon.com and the launch of Amazon Fresh 2 hour delivery as a core Prime benefit. I enjoy dancing, playing the piano, preforming a one person show of Hamilton the Musical to myself, and playing Nintendo games!

      blurb: |-
        I recently graduated from Harvard College, jointly in Computer Science and Statistics. My interest are modeling uncertainty in deep learning, computational cognitive neuroscience, as well as interpretability in ML. I spent a summer doing data science with the Siri Search team at Apple and another summer on ML research for Nuro, an autonomous vehicle startup. In my spare time, I like exploring the outdoors, catching plays or musicals, and checking out cool restaurants or bars. I was born and raised on the sunny shores of Singapore and have never quite adapted to Cambridge weather.

      blurb: |-
        During my PhD, I worked primarily on understanding the presence of meaningfully diverse optima in the solution space of machine learning problems and designed algorithms to discover a representative solution set of that diversity. The specific algorithms I worked on involved Bayesian Non-negative Matrix Factorization and policy-gradient methods in Reinforcement Learning. Healthcare applications included understanding comorbidities in Autism and learning treatment strategies for Sepsis (in the ICU). I’m currently working in the data-science consulting space where I engage with a broader class of modeling techniques. My goal is to understand business problems, identify and apply appropriate algorithms to solve them, and convert modeling solutions to actionable business decisions.
