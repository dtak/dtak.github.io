      blurb: |-
        My research focuses on reasoning in uncertainty, causal inference, and learning interpretable models for medical decision-making and problems in healthcare. I completed my PhD in 2019 at the University of Basel in Switzerland, where I was advised by Prof. Volker Roth.  Prior to this, I received my MSc at the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa. Apart from research, I enjoy travelling, learning about other cultures, playing badminton and cooking.

      blurb: |-
        I am interested in uncertainty estimation for deep models; more broadly, I am interested in building models with gauranteed properties that align with task-specific desiderata, such as interpretability, risk-awareness, satifaction of domain-specific constraints. I like to spend my spare time engineering DtAK shennanigans.

        In my research, I work on improving human-machine decision making by optimizing machine learning models with human feedback. In my free time, I enjoy cooking, and playing board games with my partner and cat (the cat is a sore loser).

      blurb: |-
        I work on uncertainty quantification and tractable approximate inference for deep Bayesian latent variable models, with applications in health-care. Before joining DtAK, I earned my Masters in Music in Contemporary Improvisation from the New England Conservatory in 2016 and my AB in Computer Science from Harvard College in 2015.

      blurb: |-
        I did my undergrad at UC Berkeley in Applied Math and a minor in American History. In industry, I worked for 2 years as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon. I was the technical lead for mobile app development in the acquisition of Whole Foods Market onto Amazon.com and the launch of Amazon Fresh 2 hour delivery as a core Prime benefit. I enjoy dancing, playing the piano, preforming a one person show of Hamilton the Musical to myself, and playing Nintendo games!

        My research focuses on optimizing classifiers, regressors, and autoencoders to be more interpretable, robust, and consistent with expert knowledge. In my free time, I enjoy cooking, singing, and making extremely _corny_ jokes!

      blurb: |-
        I work on probabilistic models, interpretable machine learning, and healthcare applications. I am interested in personalizing mental healthcare and advances in Bayesian neural networks. I want my research to have an impact in the world, for which I collaborate regularly with psychiatrists at Massachusetts General Hospital, and experts in Human-Computer-Interaction. How can we better quantify uncertaint? How can we design expressive, interpretable priors in Bayesian models? How can we combine human knowledge with data-driven evidence? I love Japanese culture, sports of any kind, and playing with my dwarf rabbit Taiko.

      blurb: |-
        During my PhD, I worked primarily on understanding the presence of meaningfully diverse optima in the solution space of machine learning problems and designed algorithms to discover a representative solution set of that diversity. The specific algorithms I worked on involved Bayesian Non-negative Matrix Factorization and policy-gradient methods in Reinforcement Learning. Healthcare applications included understanding comorbidities in Autism and learning treatment strategies for Sepsis (in the ICU). Iâ€™m currently working in the data-science consulting space where I engage with a broader class of modeling techniques. My goal is to understand business problems, identify and apply appropriate algorithms to solve them, and convert modeling solutions to actionable business decisions.

        Lincoln Laboratory and is currently pursuing a PhD from the University
        of Toronto, affiliated with Vector Institute. His research encompasses
        various efforts addressing decision making under uncertainty grounded
        in challenges within healthcare.
