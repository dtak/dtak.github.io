      blurb: |-
        My research focuses on reasoning in uncertainty, causal inference, and learning interpretable models for medical decision-making and problems in healthcare. I completed my PhD in 2019 at the University of Basel in Switzerland, where I was advised by Prof. Volker Roth.  Prior to this, I received my MSc at the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa. Apart from research, I enjoy travelling, learning about other cultures, playing badminton and cooking.

      blurb: |-
        I am interested in uncertainty estimation for deep models; more broadly, I am interested in building models with gauranteed properties that align with task-specific desiderata, such as interpretability, risk-awareness, satifaction of domain-specific constraints. I like to spend my spare time engineering DtAK shennanigans.

        In my research, I work on improving human-machine decision making by optimizing machine learning models with human feedback. In my free time, I enjoy cooking, and playing board games with my partner and cat (the cat is a sore loser).

      blurb: |-
        I work on uncertainty quantification and tractable approximate inference for deep Bayesian latent variable models, with applications in health-care. Before joining DtAK, I earned my Masters in Music in Contemporary Improvisation from the New England Conservatory in 2016 and my AB in Computer Science from Harvard College in 2015.

      blurb: |-
        I did my undergrad at UC Berkeley in Applied Math and a minor in American History. In industry, I worked for 2 years as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon. I was the technical lead for mobile app development in the acquisition of Whole Foods Market onto Amazon.com and the launch of Amazon Fresh 2 hour delivery as a core Prime benefit. I enjoy dancing, playing the piano, preforming a one person show of Hamilton the Musical to myself, and playing Nintendo games!

      blurb: |-
        I recently graduated from Harvard College, jointly in Computer Science and Statistics. My interest are modeling uncertainty in deep learning, computational cognitive neuroscience, as well as interpretability in ML. I spent a summer doing data science with the Siri Search team at Apple and another summer on ML research for Nuro, an autonomous vehicle startup. In my spare time, I like exploring the outdoors, catching plays or musicals, and checking out cool restaurants or bars. I was born and raised on the sunny shores of Singapore and have never quite adapted to Cambridge weather.
