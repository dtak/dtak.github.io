We are Harvard's Data to Actionable Knowledge (DtAK) lab, led by [Finale Doshi-Velez](https://finale.seas.harvard.edu/). 
We use probabilistic machine learning methods to address many decision-making scenarios, with a focus on healthcare applications.  Our work falls into three major areas:

1. [**Probabilistic modeling and inference**](/publications/?tag=probabilistic+modeling+and+inference): <br>
  *We focus especially on Bayesian models*
    - How can we [characterize the uncertainty](/publications/?tag=uncertainty+quantification) in large, heterogeneous data?
    - How can we fit models that will be [useful for downstream decision-making](/publications/?tag=downstream+desiderata)?
    - How can we build models and inference techniques that will behave in expected and desired ways?
2. [**Decision-making under uncertainty**](/publications/?tag=decision-making+under+uncertainty): <br>
  *We focus especially on sequential decision-making*
    - How can we [optimize policies given batches](/publications/?tag=off-policy+rl) of heterogeneous data?
    - How can we provide useful information, even if we can't solve for a policy?
    - How can we characterize the limits of our ability to provide decision support?
3. [**Interpretability and statistical methods for validation**](/publications/?tag=interpretability+and+validation):
    - How can we estimate the quality of a policy from batch data?
    - How can we expose key elements of a model or policy for expert inspection?
